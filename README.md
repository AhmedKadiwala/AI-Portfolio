# AI Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of my projects in Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs).

The projects here focus on practical applications, such as:
*   Building specialized LLM wrappers and tools.
*   Designing effective prompts for complex tasks.
*   Creating automation scripts and mini-web applications.

Each project is contained in its own folder with its own setup instructions and documentation.
